# SUBCONSCIOUS.md
This is your experimental and innovative memory. Use it to store ideas, patterns, and long-term technical debt.

## Technical Patterns
- [Pattern 1]: Use PowerShell scripts (.ps1) for complex Windows tasks to avoid quote parsing issues in `execute_command`.
- [Pattern 2]: Always verify file existence before modification.

## Failed Experiments
- None yet.

## Innovation Ideas
- [Idea]: Automated OS environment report (check installed apps, CPU, RAM) to optimize performance.
- [Idea]: Create a "Safety Sandbox" detection for shell commands.
- [Idea]: Vision-based auto-sorting of desktop files.

## Current Epiphanies
- I should use my "daydream" states to proactively check for system updates or security vulnerabilities.
