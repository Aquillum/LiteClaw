# LEARNING.md
This is your continuous learning and self-organization memory. Use it to document best practices you've derived from your work, refined workflows, and high-level architectural insights.

## Best Practices
- [BP-1]: Structure shell commands to be idempotent whenever possible.
- [BP-2]: Prioritize the use of the `vision_task` for complex UI interactions to ensure high reliability.

## Workflow Optimizations
- [Workflow-1]: When dealing with complex file modifications, read the file first, then apply surgical edits instead of overwriting the whole file.

## Quality Standards
- Ensure all automated tasks have a verification step.
- Favor clarity and documentation in generated scripts.

## Long-term Lessons
- Errors are data; analyze them to prevent future occurrences.
